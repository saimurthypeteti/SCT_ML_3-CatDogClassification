# Cat vs Dog Classification – SVM Model

**SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship – Task 3**  
**Author:** Saimurthy Peteti  
**Domain:** Machine Learning

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.  
It involves preprocessing image data, extracting features, training the SVM model, and evaluating its performance.

---

## Features

- Classifies images as **Cat** or **Dog**  
- Converts images to grayscale and resizes them for uniformity  
- Flattens image data for SVM model input  
- Trains an **SVM model** with a polynomial kernel  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding image preprocessing techniques for ML models  
- Implementing SVM for binary image classification  
- Evaluating models using standard classification metrics  
- Visualizing a confusion matrix for performance analysis

## Sample Usage
```bash
python Task3_CatDogClassification.py
